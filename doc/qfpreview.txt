INTRODUCTION                                        *vim-qf-preview* *qfpreview*

vim-qf-preview is a |ftplugin| for the |quickfix-window| and |location-list-window|
to quickly preview the file with the quickfix error under the cursor in a
|popup-window|.

The popup window is placed above the quickfix or location list window without
rearranging the current window layout.

Moving the cursor in any direction while the popup window is displayed will
close it. See also |qfpreview_close| mappings below.
