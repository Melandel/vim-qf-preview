INTRODUCTION                                        *vim-qf-preview* *qfpreview*

vim-qf-preview is a |ftplugin| for the |quickfix-window| and |location-list-window|
to quickly preview the file with the quickfix error under the cursor in a
|popup-window|.

The popup window opens up directly above (or below) the quickfix or location
list window without rearranging the current window layout. It always has the
same width as the quickfix or location list window where it was opened from.

MAPPINGS                                                  *qfpreview-mappings*

                                                       *qf_p* *qfpreview_p*
p       In the quickfix window navigate the cursor to the desired error and
        press "p" to open a popup window displaying the file containing the
        error. The window is scrolled such that the buffer line with the error
        is at the top of the window.

                                                            *qfpreview_x*
x       Press "x" or move the cursor in any direction to close the popup
        window.

                                                            *qfpreview_CTRL-J*
CTRL-J  Scroll the popup window down 2 lines.

                                                            *qfpreview_CTRL-K*
CTRL-K  Scroll the popup window up 2 lines.

Note In older Vim versions pressing CTRL-J or CTRL-K will first jump to the
first buffer line and start scrolling from there. Pressing CTRL-L will redraw
the window and put the line with the error back to the top of the popup
window. After that CTRL-J or CTRL-K will scroll the text as intended.

==============================================================================
MOUSE EVENTS                                                *qfpreview-mouse*

While the mouse pointer is on the popup window, mouse scroll events will cause
the text to scroll up or down as one would expect. Click on "X" in the top
right corner to close the window.
