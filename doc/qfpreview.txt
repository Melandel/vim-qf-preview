INTRODUCTION                                        *vim-qf-preview* *qfpreview*

vim-qf-preview is a |ftplugin| for the |quickfix-window| and |location-list-window|
to quickly preview the file with the quickfix error under the cursor in a
|popup-window|.

The popup window is opened directly above the quickfix window (or below,
depending on its position), without rearranging the current window layout.

Moving the cursor in any direction while the popup window is displayed will
close it.

MAPPINGS                                                  *qfpreview-mappings*

Quickfix window ~

<plug>(qf-preview-open)                              *<plug>(qf-preview-open)*
            Open a popup window with the file containing the quickfix error
            the cursor is currently on. The window will be scrolled such that
            the buffer line with the error is at the top of the popup window.

            Note: To avoid conflicts with other plugins, the key mapping is
            not bound to any key-sequence by default. You will first have to
            bind <plug>(qf-preview-open) to a key of your choice.

            For example, to open the popup window with "p", add the following
            to |qf.vim|: >
                " in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/qf.vim
                nmap <buffer> p <plug>(qf-preview-open)
<
            Or alternatively, if you prefer to keep your plugin settings in
            your |vimrc|: >
                augroup qfpreview
                  autocmd!
                  autocmd FileType qf nmap <buffer> p <plug>(qf-preview-open)
                augroup END

                                                    *qfpreview-popup-mappings*
